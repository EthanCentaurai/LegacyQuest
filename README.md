LegacyQuest
===========

Do you dislike the new questlog/worldmap hybrid interface introduced in Warlords of Draenor?

Then this addon could be for you!


What it does
------------

LegacyQuest separates the questlog from the worldmap and changes it back to the "double wide" interface from Mists of Pandaria.


Configuration
-------------

There are no options for this addon.  Simply install and go!


Translations
------------

This addon should work for everyone regardless of language.
